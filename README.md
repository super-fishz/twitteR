## DEPRECATION

This is the start of a relatively leisurely deprecation period for `twitteR`, in favor of using [`rtweet`](https://github.com/mkearney/rtweet). Please start looking to switch over to that package. If you have any questions contact myself or @mkearney

## twitteR
twitteR is an R package which provides access to the Twitter API. Most functionality of the API is supported, with a bias towards API calls that are more useful in data analysis as opposed to daily interaction. 

## Getting Started

- Please read the [user vignette](http://geoffjentry.hexdump.org/twitteR.pdf), which admittedly can get a bit out of date
- Create a Twitter application at http://dev.twitter.com. Make sure to give the app read, write and direct message authority.
- Take note of the following values from the Twitter app page: "API key", "API secret", "Access token", and "Access token secret".
- You can use the CRAN version (stable) via the standard `install.packages("twitteR")` or use the github version. To do the latter:
  - `install.packages(c("devtools", "rjson", "bit64", "httr"))`
  - Make sure to restart your R session at this point
  - `library(devtools)`
  - `install_github("geoffjentry/twitteR")`
- At this point you should have `twitteR` installed and can proceed:
  - `library(twitteR)`
  - `setup_twitter_oauth("API key", "API secret")`
    - The `API key` and `API secret` are from the Twitter app page above. This will lead you through `httr`'s OAuth authentication process. I recommend you look at the man page for `Token` in `httr` for an explanation of how it handles caching. 
  - You should be ready to go!
